This repository contains customized Matlab codes to reproduce the six figures in the paper, Liao et al., Compilation of longitudinal microbiota data and hospitalome from hematopoietic cell transplantation patients, Scientific Data (2021). The folders are structured as the following:

Figure 1, displaying a patient timeline: example1_display_patient_timeline/main.m

Figure 2, visualizing the entire dataset of microbiota compositions: example2_visualize_compositional_states/main.m

Figure 3, relative frequency of antibiotics administered to HCT patients at MSK by oral and intravenous routes: example3_drug_administration_stats/main.m

Figure 4, inferring the impact of antibiotics on the microbiota using regularized regression: example4_impacts_of_antibiotics/main.m

Figure 5,6, intestinal domination increases a patientâ€™s risk of bloodstream infection: example5_survival_analysis/main.m
